        <h2>GraphQL vs. REST</h2>
	<p>The openf1 API platform chose <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as query language because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators. The ability to define precisely the data you want — and only the data you want — is a powerful advantage over the traditional REST API endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.</p>
